# Dev Log – July 1, 2025

Beginning the reverse-token modeling project and commit to an execution-focused 2 weeks

**Motivation:**  
I've been thinking about this project for a long time, but it's time to get my hands dirty. Inspired by the Arrow of Time and Reverse Modeling papers, I want to run an experiment that explores whether reversing sequences flips the direction of causality that a model learns.

**Today:**
- Created this GitHub repo
- Wrote initial README and goals

**Next Steps:**
- Finalize dataset selection (Wikipedia or TinyStories)
- Train BPE tokenizer on original + reversed
- Tokenize a small corpus and inspect token stats

**Deadline:** July 17 – working prototype with logs, results, and a trained forward vs. backward model.
